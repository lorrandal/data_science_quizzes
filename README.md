# data_science_quizzes

In this project I solve the following three quizzes of data science:

## Quizzes
### Quiz 1
Create a list of numbers with the following properties: 1) Minimum 100 distinct values, 2) the Mean of all values is 1000 (+/- 0.5), 3) the standard Deviation is 10 (+/- 0.1)


### Quiz 2
Implement a solution to the following problem

_Imagine there is a country in which couples only want boys.
Couples continue to have children until they have their first boy. If they get a boy, they stop getting children.
What is the long-term ratio of boys to girls in the country?_
	
### Quiz 3
Using the data set http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult:

- Explore the data and visualize and explain two interesting findings of your choice
- Build a linear model to predict wether a person makes over 50K a year


The work on each of these questions is contained in: ```quiz1.py```,```quiz2.py``` and ```quiz3.py```.
The development and discussion of the 3 quizzes are present in the notebook: ```quizzes.ipynb```.
It can also be viewed using this viewer: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lorrandal/data_science_quizzes/blob/master/quizzes.ipynb

```Data``` folder contains the dataset used for quiz 3. ```plots``` folder contains the plots from quiz 3.
